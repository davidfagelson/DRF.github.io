            <custom-divp style="font-size: 16pt">Have you ever wondered what the difference is between the rule of law and the control of people through pure power? Have you ever thought about how you would proove that you had a certain right? Where would you look to find the sources of authority to show that you actually have a right to own a gun or that the death penalty is, or is not, cruel and unusual? Have you ever wondered why you ought to obey the law, apart from your fear of being punished? These are all philosophical questions of law of three distinct types. This course focuses on these three philosophical problems in law. The first, which is a question of definition, asks what it means to say something is the law. The second, is a question of sources. It concerns itself with where we look to find our law. The final question is one of morality. It concerns the extent and limits of our obligation to obey the law.    More formally, these are respectively questions of legal, constitutional and political theory. A basic presumption of the course is that one cannot really understand these problems of law deeply without considering them together. We will engage in that joint exploration to understand when law actually exists and what you should do about it. </custom-divp><br><br>
              
      
            <custom-divp style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: arial;"><u>SKILLS</u><br><br><br> The majority of this course consists in abstract reasoning. Even when we apply these ideas to practical situations you will be challenged to consider them in the context of different theories of interpretion, different definitions of law and different principles of morality. It is  not assumed that you have had any prior training in philosophical reasoning.   However, it is assumed that you are comfortable thinking analytically and conceptually. The latter is particularly important. Philosophy concerns itself with the meaning of things.  In many respects it is a matter of establishing definitions. You will not find the answer to these definitions in any dictionary or encyclopedia.  In this course you will learn to parse ideas, look for internal contradictions in definitions, make analogies between different concepts and apply them all to existing problems in law and society.  By the end of the course you should
            
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li> 1. understand when institutions actually approximate some conception of the rule of law;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>2. be familiar with different theories of interpretation both of posited rules and moral principles;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>3. be familiar with different moral justifications for law and the limits of legal obligations, if any;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>4&nbsp; be able to apply these ideas to different legal problems in public and private law.</li>

              <u>READING</u> <br><br>Philosophy is somewhat akin to mathmatics, only with words.  Like math, the concepts can get very abstract.  Although all the reading is in English, and mostly jargon free, you may sometimes wonder what language it is actually written in.  You should expect for the reading to take 3x longer per page than in your other classes.  You will have to read each assignment more than once in order to understand it. You won't be able to understand the reading without taking notes while you are reading. <br><br>It can sometimes feel like a long cumbersome process but if you put in the effort you will find it extremely rewarding.  You will gain an unmatched clarity of comprehension of the most fundamental legal and moral questions of our time. It is impossible to complete, let alone do well in, this class without doing each and every one of the readings. This is not a class where you can skip or forget to do the reading and just hope
          to coast along.<br><br><br>
          <u>ACTIVE CLASS PARTICIPATION:</u><br><br> All students are expected to attend class
            regularly and to be prepared to discuss the reading. Students may be
            called upon to participate in class and <u><strong>no passing is permitted</strong></u>. Each
            student will be allowed 1 un-excused absence. Any additional
            un-excused absence will reduce your final grade by one grade per
            absence. Study the class calendar carefully to make sure you don't have
            any prior commitments that would preclude you from meeting these
            requirements. <br><br><br>
            <u>ASSIGNMENTS:</u><br><br>There will be a midterm, an analytical paper and a final exam according to the following schedule.  These dates are subject to change depending upon the rate of our progress in class. <br />

				<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FFFF99;">Grading</span> <br><br>Grading standards are in part subjective and excellence in one area may
              compensate for deficiencies in another. No curve will be used to
              calculate the grades in this class. Hence, it is theoretically possible
              for every student to receive an A if he or she meets the standards for
              that grade. My primary goals are for each student to develop the
              critical thinking skills and to understand the ideas covered in this
              course by the time it is completed. If later exams and papers
              illustrate this proficiency, earlier grades which do not will be
              discounted. The following will give you a general guide to the typical
              performance associated with each letter grade.<br><br>
				
			While displaying an understanding of the course materials is very important, the quality of your writing is a central part of my evaluation of your work. At a minimum, you must make sure that the grammar and syntax of your essays are correct. Papers that are disorganized or poorly written will be graded downwards. Do not hand in the first draft of your work. Apart from the presentation of your work, the following criteria will be used: <br><br>
           
             A: all course requirements met, work shows full understanding of course material and an original perspective on the subject <br><br>
              B:
                all course requirements met, work shows full understanding of course
                material (or satisfactory understanding of course material and an
                original perspective on the subject)<br><br>
              C: all course requirements met, work shows satisfactory understanding of course material<br><br>
              D:
                work fails to meet minimum course requirements, either in full and
                timely completion of requirements or in satisfactory understanding of
                course material<br><br>
            F: work falls far below minimum
                course requirements either in full and timely completion of
                requirements or in satisfactory understanding of course material.<br><br><br><br>
          
        
         
				<span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #FFFF99;">University and Classroom Standards</span><br><br>
         
         
      Freedom of expression is at the root of academic discourse and the advancement of knowledge. 
              This course will deal with a wide range of topics, some of which may challenge a student’s deeply held beliefs and perhaps even cause offense. While no topic will be censored simply
              because it has this effect, students are expected to treat the differing views of others with respect.
              While tolerance toward the opinions of others does not preclude expressions of disagreement,
              which are, indeed, encouraged, it does require that these expressions be based on the content of
              the ideas expressed and not on personal traits or values of the speaker. All class participants will
              be expected to tolerate the expression of opposing views and to engage in reasoned discourse
              about them.<br><br>
				
I will endeavour to ensure that the classroom is free of any conduct that has the purpose or effect
              of creating an intimidating or hostile environment. Furthermore, I will attempt to give each
              student an opportunity to express his or her own opinion and to treat student opinions with respect. Any student who believes that he or she has not been given adequate opportunity to contribute to class discussions is encouraged to bring this to my attention.<br><br><br><br>

				<span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #FFFF99;">Academic Integrity</span><br><br> <br>
         The American University&rsquo;s &ldquo;Academic Integrity Code&rdquo; governing standards for academic
              conduct apply. Students may discuss the subject matter of their essays with anyone. All
              students, however, must compose their own essays and may not show or read their essays to any
              other persons, except for proofreading or typing assistance by a person not enrolled or previously
              enrolled in the course.
              The use of another person&rsquo;s words or ideas without proper attribution constitutes plagiarism or false authorship. Both are serious academic offenses. By turning in an essay, a student is 
              certifying that the essay is entirely his/her own work. If there are any questions about this matter, consult the Academic Integrity Code or see the instructor. It will never be tolerated, 
              under any circumstances and your case will be referred to the Dean &ndash; WITHOUT EXCEPTION 
              AND IMMEDIATELY. It is your responsibility to be familiar with the University&rsquo;s Academic Integrity Code, which you find on-line at: <br>

				<span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #FFFF99;">Emergency Preparedness</span><br><br> <br><br> 
           
           In the event of a declared pandemic (influenza or other communicable disease), American
              University will implement a plan for meeting the needs of all members of the university
              community. Should the university be required to close for a period of time, we are committed to
              ensuring that all aspects of our educational programs will be delivered to our students. These
              may include altering and extending the duration of the traditional term schedule to complete
              essential instruction in the traditional format and/or use of distance instructional methods.
              Specific strategies will vary from class to class, depending on the format of the course and the
              timing of the emergency. Faculty will communicate class-specific information to students via
              AU e-mail and Blackboard, while students must inform their faculty immediately of any absence
              due to illness. Students are responsible for checking their AU e-mail regularly and keeping
              themselves informed of emergencies. In the event of a declared pandemic or other emergency,
              students should refer to the AU Web site (www. prepared. american.edu) and the AU
              information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information, as well as contact
              their faculty and/or respective dean&rsquo;s office for course and school/ college-specific information. <br><br> <br><br>        
      <span style="font-weight: bolder; color: #FFFF99;">What do I expect from you?</span><br>
              <br>
              <strong><u>Punctual attendance</u></strong><br>
              <br>
              This is mandatory and forms part of your overall grading. Please contact me preferably prior to absence, or as soon as possible after the missed class.<br>
              <br>
              <strong><u>Come to class prepared</u></strong><br>
              <br>
              Engage with your reading. With everything you read ask yourself: What the author is trying to say? From what perspective are they writing? In what social/historical/philosophical context
              have they written what they have written? Do you disagree/agree with their view? Why? Don&rsquo;t 
              forget: Class Participation forms a huge part of your overall grade!<br>

              <strong><u>Be honest with me</u></strong><br>
              <br>
              I am here to help you learn and form your opinions and I really care about doing that well. If 
              you feel there is a certain area I could improve the class in, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to let me know.
              I will keep an open and friendly classroom atmosphere and am also available to talk one-on-one 
              in my office hours/by email. I expect to see you there at least once during the semester.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>              <u>Treat your peers with respect</u></strong><br>
              <br>
              Keep an open mind, engage with the material, participate in discussion and treat your classmates with respect. This means respecting divergent views as well as allowing them to learn &ndash; class
            disruptions (walking in and out, chatting etc) will be reflected in your participation grade.<br><br><br>
