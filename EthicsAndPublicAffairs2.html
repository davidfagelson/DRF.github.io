  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Content</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This course will examine the nature and application of justice to
issues of global concern. An inquiry such as this must begin with a
conceptual and ethical over view about the nature of justice, human
rights, and their justification. Once we have considered the various
conceptual and normative views of justice and rights we will examine
various contexts, such as military intervention in another sovereign
state, protection against genocide, and transfer of resources to poor
nations, in which some right is thought to apply. Finally we will also
consider specific rights to free speech, religion, privacy etc., to see
what the basis is for these rights and how, if at all, they are
vindicated.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skills</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although
this is a graduate course there is no assumption that you have had any
prior course about human rights. It is assumed, however, that you will
have had some exposure to conceptual and normative (that is to say
ethical) reasoning. The course also assumes that you have the capacity
to synthesize information and present your own ideas orally and in
writing. This course will help develop further your analytical skills
particularly as they apply to legal and moral reasoning. This course is
designed not only to teach you the ideas of others but also to help you
develop the capacity to engage in original thinking and research to
advance those ideas further. Hence, it is absolutely essential to have
completed each reading assignment and to be prepared to speak in each
class.</p>

class participation : all students are expected to attend class
regularly and to be prepared to discuss the reading. Students may be
called upon to participate in class and no passing is permitted. Each
student will be allowed 1 un-excused absences. Any additional
un-excused absence will reduce your final grade by one whole grade per
absence. Study the class calendar carefully to make sure you don't have
any prior commitments that would preclude you from meeting these
requirements.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">*<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There
will be a final paper of approximately 20-25 pages due on the date of the
final exam. This paper is not expected to be a research paper but
rather an in depth analysis of some issue of global justice chosen by
the student in consultation with the professor. It will be written
along the following schedule.....<span class="style18">[if in the teacher's opinion, students are not  reading the assigned material in advance, there will be a final exam that will count 30% towards the final grade with the value of the other exercises deacreasing  proportionately] </span></p>
  <p style="text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">* <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Students will provide a two page annotated outline together with a one page bibliography by the fourth week of class.</p>

the eighth week of class, students will provide a seven page draft of
the paper outlining the basic arguments and ideas to be included in the
final paper. </p>

  <p>Grading (subject to qualification described below)</p>

  <br>
  <p>Standards:
Grading standards are in part subjective and excellence in one area may
compensate for deficiencies in another. No curve will be used to
calculate the grades in this class. Hence, it is theoretically possible
for every student to receive an A if he or she meets the standards for
that grade. My primary goals are for each student to develop the
critical thinking skills and to understand the ideas covered in this
course by the time it is completed. If later exams and papers
illustrate this proficiency, earlier grades which do not will be
discounted. The following will give you a general guide to the typical
performance associated with each letter grade.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <br>
  <p>A: all course requirements met, work shows full understanding of course material and an original perspective on the subject</p>
  <p>B:
all course requirements met, work shows full understanding of course
material (or satisfactory understanding of course material and an
original perspective on the subject)</p>
  <p>C: all course requirements met, work shows satisfactory understanding of course material</p>
  <p>D:
work fails to meet minimum course requirements, either in full and
timely completion of requirements or in satisfactory understanding of
course material</p>
  <p>F: work falls far below minimum
course requirements either in full and timely completion of
requirements or in satisfactory understanding of course material.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">University and Classroom Standards</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <br>
  <p>The
American University's "Academic Integrity Code" governing standards for
academic conduct apply. Students may discuss the subject matter of
their essays with anyone. All students, however, must compose their own
essays and may not show or read their essays to any other persons,
except for proofreading or typing assistance by a person not enrolled
or previously enrolled in the course. The use of another person's words
or ideas without proper attribution constitutes plagiarism or false
authorship. Both are serious academic offenses. By turning in an essay,
a student is certifying that the essay is entirely his/her own work. If
there are any questions about this matter, consult the Academic
Integrity code or see the instructor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>***************</p>
  <br>
  <p>Freedom
of expression is at the root of academic discourse and the advancement
of knowledge. This course will deal with a wide range of topics, some
of which may challenge a student's deeply held beliefs and perhaps even
cause offense. While no topic will be censored simply because it has
these effects, students are expected to treat the differing views of
others with respect. While a tolerance towards the opinions of others
does not preclude expressions of disagreement, which are, indeed,
encouraged, it does require that these expressions be based on the
content of the ideas expressed and not on the personal traits or values
of the speaker. All class participants will be expected to tolerate the
expression of opposing views and to engage in reasoned discourse about
them.</p>
  <p>I will endeavor to ensure that the classroom is free of
any conduct that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating
or hostile environment. Furthermore, I will attempt to give each
student an opportunity to express his or her own opinions and to treat
student opinions with respect. Any student who believes that he or she
has not been given fair or adequate opportunity to contribute to class
discussion is encouraged to bring this to my attention.</p>
  <p>I am
genuinely interested in student development and the generation of
critical understanding of the issues addressed in this course. If you
have any questions or problems and would like to discuss them with me,
please call me, visit me during my office hours, or make an appointment
to meet with me at a mutually convenient time and location. If problems
arise that may affect your performance in this course (e.g. academic,
health, family, or other personal matters), it is important that you
bring these issues to my attention when they arise and not wait until
they interfere with some class exercise such as a paper or an exam. I
am eager to assist you in making this an interesting and beneficial
educational experience.</p>
